# Full Report Architecture

Use this reference whenever generating the **full** country wind-market report. It is the report contract; `references/pdf-pipeline.md` only covers authoring and PDF layout mechanics.

## Positioning

The full report is a **country wind-market status master report**. It is not a strategy recommendation memo and not the lite delivery version.

Its job is to describe, with evidence boundaries:

- why wind develops in the country;
- how market capacity is segmented;
- which projects exist and what their status is;
- who the developers, owners, EPCs, OEMs, financiers, and O&M parties are;
- how policy, permitting, development flow, and PPA mechanisms work;
- where OEM procurement windows and decision chains stand today;
- what grid, storage, interconnection, curtailment, localization, and financing constraints exist;
- which conclusions are verified facts, which are assumptions, and which remain pending verification.

The full report must not make final go/no-go, factory-build, pricing, or bid-strategy decisions for the reader. Mingyang/MySE material should be expressed as factual relevance, procurement window, decision-chain position, opportunity MW, and pending verification, not as recommended action.

## Core Principles

> Search broadly, calculate narrowly. Collect many leads, but do not admit them loosely.

> The project ledger is the skeleton, market narrative is the explanation, project cards are the fact base, and evidence boundaries are the guardrail.

Hard rule: key project-card fields must not be deleted because the body text is compressed. The main body may summarize; the project-card appendix or card block must preserve complete fields, with `not found`, `unavailable`, or `not applicable` when evidence is absent.

Before any chapter draft, generate `canonical_facts.json` and `fact_freeze.json` after source trace, evidence table, rich master JSON, project ledger, metric ledger, policy target ledger, auction ledger, OEM allocation ledger, and capacity reconciliation are current. Chapters must cite frozen IDs for contested capacity, policy, project-status, auction/project-delta, and OEM-relationship claims. A chapter may summarize the frozen fact, but it must not recalculate capacity scopes, upgrade draft targets into enacted policy, treat political statements as policy targets, explain auction differences outside frozen facts, or turn strategic OEM preference into firm orders.

## Chapter-Agent Ownership

Full reports default to the heavy state-machine profile, not the 10-agent Standard profile. Use at least 15 logical agents and target 20 roles: main integrator, chapter workers, delayed Chapter 1 summary worker, independent verification agent, and independent reflection reviewer. If real subagents are unavailable, run the same roles sequentially and record `agentMode=collapsed-sequential`.

The main integrator is the single writer for `{slug}.json`, project/metric/policy/auction/OEM ledgers, `canonical_facts.json`, `fact_freeze.json`, `phase_state.json`, `artifact_manifest.json`, chapter input manifests, and released reports. Chapter writers write only `chapter_drafts/*.md` from their manifests.

| Chapter | Writer Role | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `chapter_0_scope_evidence_worker` | reviewer pass |
| 1 | `chapter_1_executive_summary_worker` | independent verification + reviewer pass after Chapters 2-16 |
| 2 | `chapter_2_market_fundamentals_worker` | reviewer pass |
| 3 | `chapter_3_policy_permitting_worker` | independent verification + reviewer pass |
| 4 | `chapter_4_capacity_segmentation_worker` | independent verification + reviewer pass |
| 5 | `chapter_5_project_ledger_worker` | independent verification + reviewer pass |
| 6 | `chapter_6_project_cards_worker` | independent verification + reviewer pass |
| 7 | `chapter_7_owner_decision_worker` | reviewer pass |
| 8 | `chapter_8_wind_resource_turbine_fit_worker` | reviewer pass |
| 9 | `chapter_9_oem_competition_worker` | independent verification + reviewer pass |
| 10 | `chapter_10_epc_finance_om_supply_worker` | reviewer pass |
| 11 | `chapter_11_localization_worker` | reviewer pass |
| 12 | `chapter_12_grid_storage_worker` | reviewer pass |
| 13 | `chapter_13_tariff_bankability_worker` | independent verification + reviewer pass |
| 14 | `chapter_14_procurement_window_worker` | independent verification + reviewer pass |
| 15 | `chapter_15_risk_matrix_worker` | reviewer pass |
| 16 | `chapter_16_evidence_appendix_worker` | independent verification + reviewer pass |

Critical chapter verification means the chapter writer cannot self-release the chapter. The verifier must check source-to-field continuity, capacity treatment, evidence confidence, pending-verification notes, and contradiction status before the main integrator assembles the full report.

Every chapter must have a `chapter_inputs/{slug}-chapter-*-input-manifest.json` with allowed fact IDs, metric IDs, project IDs, policy target IDs, auction IDs, OEM allocation IDs, prohibited deprecated values, and required disclosures. Chapter agents must not search, calculate capacity, choose policy targets, change project status, explain auction deltas beyond frozen facts, or copy old deprecated numbers. Missing facts become gap tasks.

Before full-report release, run the eight release audit checks across chapter drafts and assembled prose: metricId consistency, scope disclosure, capacity aggregation, OEM share, project current-status uniqueness, parent/phase rollup deduplication, unit arithmetic, and release cleanliness. Any nonzero gap blocks release and lite extraction.

## Chapter Requirements

### 0. Report Scope And Evidence Rules

Purpose: prevent drift in later capacity, project-stage, opportunity, and confidence judgments.

Required tables:

- Fact Freeze table: Fact ID, frozen statement, scope, value, included project IDs, excluded project IDs, evidence IDs, confidence.
- Capacity definition table: official auction total, identifiable project capacity, confirmed project capacity, Opportunity MW, watchlist MW, suspended/paused MW, national long-term target.
- Project-status definition table: `developmentStage` and `activityStatus` are separate. Development stage captures the legal/commercial milestone; activity status captures whether the project is active, delayed, paused, withdrawn, cancelled, or superseded.
- Opportunity capacity definition table: separate project MW, unallocated-OEM MW, and `Opportunity MW`.
- Conclusion-evidence rule table: source tier, whether it directly proves the claim, confidence, and pending verification.

Required project status fields:

| Field | Allowed Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `developmentStage` | operational, partial_operation, under_construction, construction_ready, financial_close, contracted, auction_awarded, permitted, pre_auction, early_development, watchlist, unverified | Evidence-backed development milestone |
| `activityStatus` | active, delayed, paused, withdrawn, cancelled, superseded, unknown | Current activity condition |
| `ledgerTreatment` | confirmed, watchlist, duplicate, rejected, unresolved | How the candidate is carried in the ledger |
| `capacityTreatment` | confirmed_capacity, opportunity_capacity, watchlist_capacity, excluded_inactive, excluded_duplicate, excluded_unverified, policy_target_only, auction_total_only | How the MW is allowed to enter reconciliation |

- key-number dashboard;
- project segmentation summary;
- Firm/Committed/Influenced/Unallocated/Excluded inactive OEM MW summary;
- major constraint summary;
- report date, data cutoff, and latest major update anchor.

### 2. National Power Fundamentals

Purpose: explain why wind can grow.

Required tables:

- Power mix: thermal, hydro, solar PV, wind, BESS, total capacity.
- Generation: annual total generation, wind, solar, green-power share.
- Demand and load: peak load, annual demand, demand growth, demand forecast.
- Substitution logic: thermal aging, gas import exposure, coal/gas structure, power deficit.

### 3. Policy, Permitting, Development Flow, And PPA Mechanism

Purpose: describe how projects legally and commercially progress.

Required modules:

### 4. Market Capacity Definitions And Project Segmentation

Purpose: answer the real market-capacity question.

Use this segmentation baseline:

| Layer | Count In Confirmed Capacity | Count In Opportunity Capacity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Operational | yes | no |  |
| Under construction | yes | depends on OEM relationship type/status |  |
| Financing closed | yes | depends on OEM relationship type/status |  |
| PPA/decree-backed | cautious | yes |  |
| Tendering | no/cautious | yes |  |
| MOU/JDA | no | watchlist |  |
| National target | no | upper-bound only |  |

Always provide confirmed capacity, opportunity capacity, watchlist capacity, and national long-term target capacity separately.

Suspended, paused, withdrawn, cancelled, or superseded projects must be shown explicitly. They may remain in the project universe, but their MW must flow to Excluded inactive MW, not active confirmed/opportunity/unallocated MW.

- Excluded inactive MW table: paused, withdrawn, cancelled, superseded, expired, or terminated cases and the reason they are excluded.
- OEM competition status table: existing record, developer relationship, financing precedent, risk.

Do not use ambiguous `locked MW`. It must be decomposed into Firm MW, Committed MW, Influenced MW, Unallocated MW, and Excluded inactive MW.

Required tables:

- Localization policy table: policy source, applicable projects, requirement.
- Local manufacturing footprint: company, product, location, capacity, status.
- Local service footprint: service base, spare-parts warehouse, O&M team.

### 14. Procurement Window And Decision-Chain Status

Describe who decides turbines and when.

Required subsections:

- 14.1 Unallocated OEM capacity table.
- 14.2 Procurement-window table.
- 14.3 Decision-chain table.

### 16. Data-Source And Conclusion-Confidence Appendix

Purpose: prevent the mistake of treating every conclusion as strong merely because one source is strong.

Conclusion-evidence table fields: conclusion, source, source tier, direct proof yes/no, confidence, pending verification.

Evidence requirements by conclusion type:

| Conclusion Type | Evidence Requirement |
|---|---|
| Project existence | decree, MDB, or developer official source is stronger |
| Capacity | MDB, ESIA, PPA, or decree is stronger |
| Project stage | COD, NTP, or financial close must have corresponding evidence |
| OEM award | developer, OEM, or EPC announcement is stronger |
| Tariff | tender document, PPA, or MDB document is stronger |
| O&M arrangement | contract, developer announcement, or project document is stronger |
| Mingyang relevance | usually inference; must mark basis and confidence |

Capacity and OEM conclusion evidence must cite frozen IDs from `canonical_facts.json`/`fact_freeze.json` when the claim uses a contested scope or status. For example, 230MW, 326MW, 340MW, and 96MW may all appear only if each number has a distinct frozen scope, included/excluded project list, and evidence boundary.

## Writer Flow

1. Start from source trace, evidence table, validated rich master JSON, core ledgers, and depth records.
2. Generate `canonical_facts.json` and `fact_freeze.json` after core ledgers and capacity reconciliation are current.
3. Generate a `chapter-input-manifest.json` for every chapter from frozen fact, metric, project, policy, auction, and OEM allocation IDs.
4. Write Chapter 0 from the frozen facts so capacity, status, OEM, and confidence rules are fixed.
5. Build Chapters 5 and 6 from the manifest-listed master JSON, project ledger, project-card JSON, and matching depth records. If depth records contain richer fields, update the master JSON, rebuild the affected ledger/freeze/manifest, or mark the field as unavailable before drafting.
6. Write Chapters 7-14 from manifest-listed participant, technology, grid, tariff, localization, and procurement-window records. Avoid generic company profiles.
7. Run cross-chapter audit and repair before final assembly.
8. Write Chapter 1 only after Chapters 2-16 pass audit and repairs are current, then back-check every summary number against the ledger, canonical facts, and fact freeze.
9. Run the release audit before finalizing: no metricId conflicts, no scope-less aggregate values, no capacity/OEM denominator drift, no project status conflicts, no parent/phase overcounting, no unit arithmetic errors, and no internal artifacts.
10. Keep recommendations out of the full report. If the user asks for strategy or sales actions, produce a separate executive brief, action memo, or lite addendum.
