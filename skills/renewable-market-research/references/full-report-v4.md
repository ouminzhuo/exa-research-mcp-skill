# V4 Full Report Architecture

Use this reference whenever generating the **full** country wind-market report. It is the report contract; `references/pdf-pipeline.md` only covers authoring and PDF layout mechanics.

## Positioning

The full report is a **country wind-market status master report**. It is not a strategy recommendation memo and not the lite delivery version.

Its job is to describe, with evidence boundaries:

- why wind develops in the country;
- how market capacity is segmented;
- which projects exist and what their status is;
- who the developers, owners, EPCs, OEMs, financiers, and O&M parties are;
- how policy, permitting, development flow, and PPA mechanisms work;
- where OEM procurement windows and decision chains stand today;
- what grid, storage, interconnection, curtailment, localization, and financing constraints exist;
- which conclusions are verified facts, which are assumptions, and which remain pending verification.

The full report must not make final go/no-go, factory-build, pricing, or bid-strategy decisions for the reader. Mingyang/MySE material should be expressed as factual relevance, procurement window, decision-chain position, opportunity MW, and pending verification, not as recommended action.

## Core Principles

> Search broadly, calculate narrowly. Collect many leads, but do not admit them loosely.

> The project ledger is the skeleton, market narrative is the explanation, project cards are the fact base, and evidence boundaries are the guardrail.

Hard rule: key project-card fields must not be deleted because the body text is compressed. The main body may summarize; the project-card appendix or card block must preserve complete fields, with `not found`, `unavailable`, or `not applicable` when evidence is absent.

Required tables:

- Localization policy table: policy source, applicable projects, requirement.
- Local manufacturing footprint: company, product, location, capacity, status.

Risk categories:

- policy risk;
- PPA/offtaker risk;
- FX risk;
- financing risk;

- land/ESG risk;
- logistics/lifting risk;
- localization risk;
- OEM competition risk;
- project-delay risk.

### 16. Data-Source And Conclusion-Confidence Appendix

Purpose: prevent the mistake of treating every conclusion as strong merely because one source is strong.

Conclusion-evidence table fields: conclusion, source, source tier, direct proof yes/no, confidence, pending verification.

Evidence requirements by conclusion type:

| Conclusion Type | Evidence Requirement |
|---|---|
| Project existence | decree, MDB, or developer official source is stronger |
| Capacity | MDB, ESIA, PPA, or decree is stronger |
| Project stage | COD, NTP, or financial close must have corresponding evidence |
| OEM award | developer, OEM, or EPC announcement is stronger |
| Tariff | tender document, PPA, or MDB document is stronger |
| O&M arrangement | contract, developer announcement, or project document is stronger |
| Mingyang relevance | usually inference; must mark basis and confidence |

## Writer Flow

1. Start from the validated rich master JSON, canonical project ledger, source trace, and depth records.
2. Write Chapter 0 before drafting conclusions so capacity and confidence rules are fixed.
3. Build Chapters 5 and 6 directly from the master JSON and cross-read matching depth records. If depth records contain richer fields, update the master JSON or mark the field as unavailable before drafting.
4. Write Chapters 7-14 from project-linked participant, technology, grid, tariff, localization, and procurement-window records. Avoid generic company profiles.
5. Write Chapter 1 only after Chapters 2-16 are current, then back-check every summary number against the ledger.
6. Keep recommendations out of the full report. If the user asks for strategy or sales actions, produce a separate executive brief, action memo, or lite addendum.
