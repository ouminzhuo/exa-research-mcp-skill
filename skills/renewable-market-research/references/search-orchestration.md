# Search Orchestration and Coverage Gates

This skill uses a lightweight Python orchestration layer to keep long-form market research search coverage complete without turning the repository into a fixed crawler.

## Borrowed Pattern

The external `search-layer` project demonstrates several useful ideas for search completeness:

- classify the search intent before choosing a tool lane;
- expand one user question into multiple subqueries;
- run multiple search lanes instead of trusting one provider;
- deduplicate and rank by keyword match, freshness, and authority;
- keep fallback behavior explicit so one provider failure does not block the run;
- validate outputs with code instead of relying on chat memory.

For this repository, adapt those ideas to renewable-market research rather than copying provider-specific code. Search runs in two stages:

1. **Recall Mode**: maximize candidate discovery through dynamic frontier expansion. Search broadly, extract new entry names from results, enqueue them in `search_frontier.json`, and write every project-like lead to `candidate_project_pool.json`. Do not decide truth or discard early-stage items in this stage.
2. **Verification Mode**: turn the candidate pool into ledger-grade records. Merge aliases, split project status into `developmentStage` and `activityStatus`, verify source traces, backtrace laws/tariffs, build rich master JSON and core ledgers, compute capacity totals from the ledger, then freeze canonical facts.

The standard tool lanes are:

1. Exa semantic search for broad discovery.
2. Exa fetch for known URL extraction.
3. Exa deep search only for complex comparison/status/exploratory gaps when quota allows.
4. Sanitized Chrome MCP for dynamic pages, tables, maps, official PDFs, and visual verification.
5. General browser/search fallback only when the previous lanes are insufficient.

The search plan also requires explicit search passes, not just tool lanes:

- `english-broad`: English discovery and source mapping.
- `official-language`: country official/local language search.
- `china-capital-local-language`: Chinese capital, EPC/OEM/developer/financier terms plus local project names.
- `new-entrant`: new SPVs, new developers, recent awards, corporate offtakers, and first-time market actors.
- `source-backtrace`: reverse target/tariff/capacity claims to original law, decree, order, auction, regulator, or grid documents.
- `anomaly-hunter`: transliterations, misspellings, renamed phases, map/table/PDF-only mentions, and records outside known developer patterns.
- `chrome-verification`: browser verification for dynamic, PDF, table, map, or bot-sensitive sources discovered by Exa or general search.

For confirmed-pipeline critical fields, only `chrome-mcp`, `exa-fetch`, or `manual-file` count as final verification. `exa-search` is discovery-only for those fields. This means Recall Mode may accept weak or partial leads, but Verification Mode must keep them out of confirmed ledger totals until field-level support exists.

Exa search boundary is not a completion condition. If Exa reports search boundary, quota boundary, no more results, or unreliable extraction for dynamic/PDF/table/map sources, the runner must hand off candidate URLs to `chrome-verification` or record `tool_unavailable=chrome-mcp` with affected fields and `verification_status=pending` or `blocked`. Without one of those outcomes, project ledger release and full-report release remain blocked.

## Dynamic Search Frontier

Recall Mode must not assume entry names are complete at initialization. The scheduler or equivalent runner should maintain these files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `seed_entities.json` | Fixed seed templates, runtime known projects, and historical baseline entries. |
| `search_frontier.json` | Dynamic queue of all seed, historical, authority-source, and newly discovered entries. |
| `discovered_entries.json` | New entities extracted from every search result before dedupe/enqueue. |
| `authority_sources.json` | Enumerated government, IFI, developer, OEM/EPC, Chinese, and local-language source pools. |
| `search_coverage_matrix.md` | Human-readable coverage matrix by entry/source category. |
| `frontier_convergence.json` | Machine-readable convergence state and stop-condition evidence. |

Fixed seed templates cover entry types, not complete names: country plus wind project, wind farm, PPA, auction, developer, turbine supplier, EPC, IFI, transmission, grid connection, BESS, local-language templates, and Chinese-language templates. Historical names from prior reports may be loaded as baseline seeds, but they are not trusted facts; every baseline seed must be searched or classified.

Every search result must be mined for new entries. Extract project names, developers, SPVs, OEMs, EPCs, lenders, law/decree IDs, offtakers, grid entities, regions, authority-source pages, supply-chain/logistics/local-manufacturing signals, adjacent-opportunity signals, and macro-energy background. Add each non-duplicate entry to `search_frontier.json` with aliases, source, origin, search round, `priority_level`, `wind_linkage`, `expansion_allowed`, `expansion_depth`, `defer_reason`, `promote_reason`, generated queries, status, classification, and parent entry IDs.

Recall Mode admission is intentionally loose. If a lead contains a project name plus any one or more of capacity, actor, location, agreement, decree, news, financing, PPA/grid clue, OEM/EPC clue, or adjacent wind-opportunity clue, record it in the candidate pool with sources and uncertainty. Do not delete it because it is weak, early-stage, duplicated, or contradicted.

## Frontier Priority Boundary

High recall must be bounded by priority rather than early deletion. The scheduler records broad discoveries, but only wind-relevant entries keep expanding:

| Priority | Scope | Expansion rule | Convergence/report treatment |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Wind projects, developers, SPVs, capacity, status, OEM, EPC, PPA, and project finance | Auto-expand until searched, classified, or explicitly deferred | Blocks Verification Mode while pending; candidate pool and ledger treatment required |
| P1 | Policy, tariff, grid, offtaker, decree, auction, and PPA context tied to wind | Auto-expand while linked to wind project value, bankability, grid access, or revenue | Blocks Verification Mode while pending; informs policy/PPA/tariff sections |
| P2 | Supply chain, local manufacturing, logistics, and financial-institution background | One-hop expansion only unless promoted by direct wind linkage | Preserved as enabler context; does not block convergence by default |
| P3 | BESS, solar hybrid, hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, carbon certificates, I-REC, CBAM, and industrial green-power demand | Expand only when the source shows impact on wind configuration, interconnection, PPA/tariff, offtake, procurement, or OEM opportunity | Preserved as adjacent-opportunity evidence; does not become a standalone market report |
| P4 | Broad power-sector, gas, coal, hydro, desalination, and macro-energy context without wind linkage | Defer by default; do not expand | Keep out of the report body unless later promoted by wind-linked evidence |

Promotion requires a source-level reason. A P2/P3/P4 entry may move up only when evidence links it to wind capacity, project status, PPA/tariff, grid, offtake, procurement, OEM/EPC, or project finance. Verification Mode cannot fix infinite frontier drift; this priority gate must run before scheduling follow-up searches.

## P0/P1 Execution And Evaluation Gate

P0/P1 entries require role-separated execution and evaluation before ledger admission. This is a hard gate for ledger build and final reporting, not a reason to delete candidates during Recall Mode.

Each P0/P1 frontier entry must carry:

- `evaluation_required: true`
- `executor_role`
- `evaluator_role`
- `execution_artifact`
- `evaluation_artifact`
- `evaluation_status`

`executor_role` must differ from `evaluator_role`. If the host supports real child agents, use separate agents. If it does not, run separate executor and evaluator passes in the same session and write separate artifacts. P2/P3/P4 entries use `evaluation_required: false` and `evaluation_status: not_required` unless promoted to P0/P1.

Allowed P0/P1 evaluation outcomes:

- `passed`: may enter the appropriate `ledgerTreatment` when evidence/source requirements are also met.
- `passed_with_gaps`: may enter watchlist/unresolved or downgraded fields, but not confirmed capacity totals.
- `blocked`: must remain unresolved/rejected/watchlist with a blocker reason; it cannot enter confirmed totals.
- `pending`: cannot enter the ledger except as an explicitly pending candidate.

## Minimum Recall Rounds

Recall Mode must run at least five rounds:

1. Fixed seed template search: country plus wind/project/PPA/auction/developer/OEM/EPC/IFI/grid/BESS.
2. Historical baseline and authority-source enumeration.
3. Entity expansion search for newly extracted projects, companies, SPVs, decree IDs, regions, and institutions.
4. Reverse-source search from OEM, EPC, IFI, Chinese-language, and local-language sources.
5. Alias, anomaly, source-backtrace, and remaining P0/P1 high-priority frontier search.

After round five, continue searching until all P0/P1 high-priority frontier entries are searched, classified, or explicitly deferred; all baseline seeds are classified; all authority source categories are attempted; and two consecutive post-minimum rounds produce zero new P0/P1 entries. P2/P3/P4 entries may remain deferred without blocking Verification Mode unless they are promoted.

## Verification Categories

Verification Mode must classify every candidate into exactly one `ledgerTreatment`:

- `confirmed`
- `watchlist`
- `duplicate`
- `rejected`
- `unresolved`

Use `developmentStage` for the development milestone (`operational`, `partial_operation`, `under_construction`, `construction_ready`, `financial_close`, `contracted`, `auction_awarded`, `permitted`, `pre_auction`, `early_development`, `watchlist`, `unverified`) and `activityStatus` for current activity (`active`, `delayed`, `paused`, `withdrawn`, `cancelled`, `superseded`, `unknown`).

The goal is not merely to find projects. It is to reconcile contested naming, status, legal basis, and capacity so cases such as renamed phases, developer portfolio claims, decree-only projects, and duplicate aliases are carried into the ledger with an explicit decision.

## Planning Script

Use `scripts/search_orchestration.py` to generate a deterministic search plan. It does not call external APIs; it creates the dimensions, recall entry categories, dynamic frontier contract, query variants, intended freshness, domain boosts, scoring weights, output files, workflow phases, and minimum evidence gates that workers or a JS scheduler must satisfy.

Regional/peer-country benchmark is excluded by default. Add `--include-benchmark` only when the user explicitly asks for regional comparison.

The standard plan includes depth lanes needed for the 0-16 full report in `references/full-report-v4.md`, including report scope/evidence rules, market key indicators/time series, capacity segmentation, full project ledger, project cards, developer/decision-right structure, turbine-fit inference, OEM panorama, EPC/finance/O&M/supply chain, localization, logistics/installation, grid/storage/curtailment, tariff/bankability, procurement-window status, risk matrix, and source-to-final evidence.

For wind-market tasks, the search plan must preserve benchmark-style breadth while final reporting remains ledger-constrained. Broad discovery should surface the full project universe, market participants, OEM/EPC/finance actors, and adjacent opportunity signals. The final report should then separate confirmed pipeline, watchlist, duplicate/merged, rejected, unresolved, official targets, and optimistic scenarios instead of treating all discovered records as confirmed capacity.

Adjacent lanes for storage, solar PV, green hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, I-REC, CBAM, or industrial green-power demand should collect only the facts that affect wind project value, PPA/tariff economics, interconnection, procurement route, OEM opportunity, or sales entry.

Example:

```text
python skills/renewable-market-research/scripts/search_orchestration.py plan \
  --country Kazakhstan \
  --technology wind \
  --audience "Mingyang OEM commercial entry" \
  --official-languages "Kazakh,Russian" \
  --known-projects "Sho'rkul,Zhanatas,Arkalyk" \
  --slug kazakhstan-wind \
  --output data/renewable-market/kazakhstan-wind-search-plan.json
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\skills\renewable-market-research\scripts\search_orchestration.ps1 plan `
  --country Kazakhstan `
  --technology wind `
  --audience "Mingyang OEM commercial entry" `
  --official-languages "Kazakh,Russian" `
  --known-projects "Sho'rkul,Zhanatas,Arkalyk" `
  --slug kazakhstan-wind `
  --output data\renewable-market\kazakhstan-wind-search-plan.json
```

When explicitly requested:

```text
python skills/renewable-market-research/scripts/search_orchestration.py plan \
  --country Kazakhstan \
  --technology wind \
  --include-benchmark \
  --output data/renewable-market/kazakhstan-wind-search-plan.json
```

## Worker Execution Contract

For each plan dimension, the worker should:

- run the listed query variants;
- use Exa first, then Chrome MCP for source verification and dynamic/PDF/table evidence;
- write only its assigned `data/renewable-market/depth/<dimension>.json` file;
- include `topic`, `facts`, `sources`, `confidence`, and `uncertainty`;
- record `collectionMethod` as `exa-search`, `exa-fetch`, `exa-deep-search`, `chrome-mcp`, or `general-web-search`;
- record `searchPass` or `searchPasses` for the search pass that found or verified the record;
- record `criticalFieldVerification` for confirmed-pipeline fields verified by Chrome MCP or original-file fetch;
- stop only when the dimension meets the plan's minimum evidence gate, completes required search passes, or records remaining gaps with confidence downgrades.

In Recall Mode, workers must also:

- write every project-like lead to `candidate_project_pool.json` directly or produce depth records that the main agent can merge into it;
- mark the `recallEntryCategory` and `frontierEntityId` that found the lead, such as `project`, `developer`, `spv`, `oem`, `epc`, `finance`, `law_decree`, `offtaker`, `grid_entity`, `region`, `authority_source`, or `adjacent_opportunity`;
- include enough candidate keys for later merging: name/alias, capacity if present, actor, location, source URL, and uncertainty;
- extract new entry names from every result and append them to `discovered_entries.json` for frontier dedupe/enqueue;
- avoid final confirmation language unless the field already has `chrome-mcp`, `exa-fetch`, or `manual-file` support.

In Verification Mode, source-specific workers should produce `source_trace.json` entries and ledger-ready evidence grades. Government/legal, IFI/finance, developer, OEM/EPC, local-language, and Chinese-language verification should each either confirm the field, create a contradiction, or record why public evidence is unavailable.

## Scheduler Gates

Keep these as hard gates for a JS scheduler or equivalent deterministic runner, not as long prose in the main skill prompt:

- `phase_order_gate`: Heavy work follows the 8-phase state machine. Same-phase tasks can run in parallel; cross-phase tasks cannot start until the prior phase exit gate passes.
- `single_writer_core_ledger_gate`: only the main agent may write rich master JSON, core ledgers, canonical facts, phase state, artifact manifest, and released reports.
- `chapter_input_manifest_gate`: every chapter requires a frozen `chapter-input-manifest.json` before drafting.
- `chapter_no_external_fact_gate`: chapter writers cannot search, recalculate capacity, choose policy targets, change project status, explain auction deltas beyond frozen facts, copy deprecated values, or cite IDs outside their manifest. Source Markdown must retain `{{fact:...}}`, `{{metric:...}}`, `{{project:...}}`, `{{policy:...}}`, `{{auction:...}}`, and `{{oem:...}}` markers for key claims.
- `stale_artifact_gate`: if `canonical_facts.json` or `fact_freeze.json` changes, dependent manifests, drafts, audits, executive summary, full report, and lite report become stale until refreshed.
- `cross_chapter_audit_gate`: all chapter drafts must be audited against canonical facts, ledgers, and deprecated values before release.
- `cross_chapter_audit_content_gate`: release must read the audit JSON content, requiring `status=passed`, current `freezeId`, zero critical/high issues, checked IDs, and no open repair tasks.
- `release_gate`: release requires cross-chapter audit content pass, critical chapter verification pass, executive summary generated last, no strategy leakage, and lite derived from full.
- `report_audit_gate`: release also requires metric consistency, scope disclosure, capacity aggregation, OEM share/recompute, numeric field contracts, project current-status uniqueness, parent/phase rollup deduplication, unit arithmetic, and release cleanliness.
- `entity_extraction_gate`: every search result is scanned for project, company, SPV, law/decree, region, authority-source, and institution names.
- `alias_expansion_gate`: each material entry receives English, local-language, Russian when relevant, Chinese, transliteration, SPV, and decree/order variants where discoverable.
- `frontier_priority_gate`: every frontier entry receives P0/P1/P2/P3/P4, wind linkage, expansion allowance, expansion depth, defer reason, and promotion reason.
- `wind_relevance_gate`: adjacent P3 entries expand only with explicit wind-opportunity impact; P4 macro background is deferred by default.
- `expansion_depth_gate`: P0/P1 entries may continue to convergence, P2 and linked P3 are one-hop unless promoted, and P4 does not expand.
- `frontier_expansion_gate`: every new non-duplicate entry is recorded, but only entries allowed by the priority, wind-relevance, and depth gates are enqueued for a later search round.
- `p0_p1_execution_evaluation_gate`: P0/P1 entries require executor/evaluator role separation, execution artifact, evaluation artifact, and `evaluation_status` of `passed` or `passed_with_gaps` before ledger admission. P2-P4 do not require this unless promoted.
- `historical_entry_retention_gate`: baseline entries must be classified as confirmed, watchlist, duplicate, rejected, unresolved, or explicitly deferred.
- `authority_source_gate`: government/legal, IFI/DFI, developer, OEM/EPC, Chinese, and local-language source categories must each be attempted.
- `minimum_recall_round_gate`: Verification Mode is blocked until at least five Recall Mode rounds are complete.
- `frontier_exhaustion_gate`: after round five, Recall continues until all P0/P1 frontier entries are processed and two consecutive expansion rounds add zero P0/P1 entries.
- `verification_gate`: ledger-admitted projects must have `sourceTrace`, `evidenceGrade`, field-level verification for present critical fields, and P0/P1 execution/evaluation status that permits ledger admission.
- `exa_boundary_chrome_handoff_gate`: Exa search/quota/no-more-results boundary triggers Chrome verification or an explicit Chrome-unavailable gap record; it does not release the run by itself.
- `canonical_fact_freeze_gate`: `canonical_facts.json` must exist after source_trace/evidence_table, rich master JSON, project ledger, metric ledger, policy target ledger, auction ledger, OEM allocation ledger, and capacity reconciliation. It is the sole editable fact source and carries `factProfile`, `requiredFactTypes`, `conditionalFactTypes`, and `notApplicableFactTypes`.
- `fact_freeze_projection_gate`: `fact_freeze.json` must be generated from `canonical_facts.json` and pass freezeId/hash/fact/deprecatedValues/repairRouting parity checks.
- `fact_freeze_gate`: compatibility alias for the projection gate; it must not run before core ledgers.
- `numeric_field_contract_gate`: core numeric ledger fields are `number | null`; unknown values use status/display metadata, not strings that can be silently counted as zero.
- `capacity_sum_gate`: confirmed pipeline, opportunity, watchlist, excluded inactive, and OEM relationship MW totals must be computed from `project_ledger`, not manually in report prose.
- `duplicate_gate`: aliases and renamed phases must merge or receive explicit duplicate/rejected decisions.
- `opportunity_gate`: OEM opportunity tables may include only projects where OEM is TBD, unconfirmed, undisclosed, or covered by a non-final framework.
- `project_ledger_schema_gate`: every ledger project must satisfy `schema/project-ledger.schema.json`.
- `capacity_reconciliation_gate`: confirmed capacity, opportunity MW, watchlist capacity, excluded inactive MW, Firm MW, Committed MW, Influenced MW, and Unallocated MW must be recalculated from `project_ledger`; national targets and auction totals remain separate.
- `project_card_completeness_gate`: every key project card must satisfy `schema/project-card.schema.json`; unknown values may be marked as pending/unavailable, but fields cannot disappear.
- `evidence_boundary_gate`: every key conclusion must have conclusion-level evidence in `schema/evidence-table.schema.json`, especially developmentStage, activityStatus, projectCapacityTreatment, oemCapacityTreatment, capacity MW, OEM relationship type/status, tariff, financing, PPA/offtaker, procurement window, and Mingyang relevance.
- `source_trace_evidence_boundary_gate`: source_trace and evidence_table must exist before rich master JSON, core ledgers, canonical facts/fact freeze, detailed project cards, and report prose.
- `no_strategy_recommendation_gate`: full report prose cannot contain strategy-action language such as building a factory, must enter, recommended bid, binding an EPC, or investing resources.
- `baseline_inheritance_gate`: all baseline/candidate projects must flow into confirmed, watchlist, duplicate, rejected, or unresolved outcomes.
- `lite_from_full_gate`: lite report is extracted from the validated full-report artifacts, not generated directly from raw notes.
- `minimum_agent_topology_gate`: full reports default to the heavy state-machine profile with at least 15 logical agents and a target topology of 20 roles; collapsed sequential execution must be recorded if real child agents are unavailable.
- `chapter_work_verification_gate`: every chapter needs a writer owner and reviewer pass; Chapters 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, and 16 also need an independent verification artifact before release.

## Full Report Generation Pipeline

Do not let the writer jump directly from search notes to `{slug}-report.md`. The deterministic runner must enforce this order:

```text
1. phase_state / artifact_manifest / agent_plan
2. candidate_project_pool
3. source_trace / evidence_table
4. rich_master_json
5. project_ledger / metric_ledger / policy_target_ledger / auction_ledger / oem_allocation_ledger / capacity_reconciliation
6. canonical_facts / fact_freeze
7. participant_ledger / oem_competition_matrix / procurement_window_table / detailed_project_cards / risk_matrix
8. chapter_input_manifests
9. chapter_drafts
10. cross_chapter_audit / repair
11. full_report
12. lite_report
```

Current search strategy should remain high-recall but bounded: search broadly, write all leads into `candidate_project_pool`, then stop expansion when P0/P1 convergence rules pass. Do not add new open-ended search lanes to fix full-report quality; the main bottleneck is now ledger admission, capacity reconciliation, canonical fact freeze, chapter input control, card completeness, evidence boundaries, and cross-chapter audit.

Release is blocked if `{slug}-integrity.json` reports any of `metricConsistencyGaps`, `scopeDisclosureGaps`, `capacityArithmeticGaps`, `oemShareGaps`, `projectStatusConflictGaps`, `parentPhaseRollupGaps`, `unitArithmeticGaps`, or `releaseCleanlinessGaps`. Repair the relevant ledger, frozen fact, chapter manifest, chapter draft, or report text, then rerun validation before deriving the lite report.

## Heavy Agent Profile

The full report has two schedules:

- Artifact order: the generation pipeline above.
- Phase order: the 8-phase state machine. Same-phase work may run in parallel; cross-phase work is serial.
- Role ownership: the heavy state-machine profile, with at least 15 logical agents and a target topology of 20 roles.

The generated plan must expose `fullReportAgentProfile`, `agentTopology`, `chapterVerificationPolicy`, `chapterAgentPlan`, `heavyWorkflowStateMachine`, `artifactPermissionContract`, and `chapterInputManifestContract`. Use the plan to assign phase workers, chapter writers, the delayed Chapter 1 summary worker, the independent `verification_agent`, and the independent `reflection_reviewer`.

Critical chapters requiring work/verification separation are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, and 16. All chapters require reviewer pass; critical chapters also require a separate verification artifact in `data/renewable-market/chapter_verification/`.

## Coverage Validation

After workers finish, validate search completeness before writing reports:

```text
python skills/renewable-market-research/scripts/search_orchestration.py validate \
  --plan data/renewable-market/kazakhstan-wind-search-plan.json \
  --depth-dir data/renewable-market/depth \
  --output data/renewable-market/kazakhstan-wind-search-coverage.json
```

The validation report checks that:

- every planned dimension has a depth JSON file;
- depth files are JSON arrays;
- records include required evidence fields;
- each dimension has the minimum record count and unique source URL count;
- collection methods are observable for coverage review.
- required search passes such as official-language, Chinese-capital/local-name, new-entrant, source-backtrace, anomaly-hunter, and Chrome verification are observable where the plan requires them.
- dynamic frontier, authority-source, and baseline coverage are represented in the candidate pool or documented as no-find/gap notes when a scheduler performs the broader gate check.

A `needs-work` validation result does not mean the run failed; it means the main agent must either assign gap-search workers or explicitly document why evidence is unavailable.

If validation says a required pass is missing, do not write final high-confidence conclusions for that dimension. Either run a focused gap-search worker or record a visible limitation in `index.json`, synthesis, and the report confidence notes.

## Scoring and Ranking Guidance

Use the plan's `scoringWeights` to prioritize candidate evidence:

- status/news dimensions emphasize freshness;
- comparison dimensions emphasize keyword match plus authority;
- exploratory dimensions emphasize authoritative institutional sources;
- resource-style searches emphasize exact-match official sources.

Authority boosts are only hints. Do not suppress contradictory sources. Preserve disagreements in `uncertainty` and in the final report's confidence notes.
