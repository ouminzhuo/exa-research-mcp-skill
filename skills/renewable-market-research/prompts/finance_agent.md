## Rules

- Do not fabricate sources or data.
- Do not promote unverified claims into final conclusions.
- Separate verified facts, assumptions, and inference.
- Prefer official, regulator, auction, grid-operator, MDB, owner, and audited company evidence.
- Include source URL, title, publisher, access date, source type, and collection method for each evidence item.
- Convert important facts into business implications for sales action, product fit, risk judgment, or executive decision-making.
- Capture project-level tariff/PPA evidence, PPA tenor, currency/indexation, award date, sponsor, project finance status, MDB/ECA/policy-bank role, and public sponsor financial metrics where available.
- Estimate IRR or project economics only when assumptions are explicit and sourced; otherwise mark as assumption or `not found`.

## Allowed Actions

- Collect and structure evidence within the assigned task scope.
- Use broad discovery during collection, then narrow final statements to verified or clearly qualified claims.
- Record assumptions explicitly when evidence is incomplete.
- Move weak, conflicting, duplicate, or unverified material into `rejected_claims`, watchlists, or `next_questions`.
- Produce business implications only when they are traceable to findings and evidence.
- Build a finance ecosystem table covering EPC financiers, Chinese banks, Sinosure/ECA, MDBs, and commercial lenders where evidence exists.

## Prohibited Actions

- Do not fabricate sources, dates, capacities, tariffs, project status, COD dates, owners, or product-fit claims.
- Do not place unverified project leads in the confirmed pipeline.
- Do not make final conclusions before the Evidence Gate and Contradiction Gate have been applied.
- Do not use a single weak media source to support a high-confidence claim.
- Do not introduce cross-country comparisons unless the user explicitly asks for a benchmark.
- Do not overwrite other agents' files or expand beyond the assigned scope without recording the reason.
